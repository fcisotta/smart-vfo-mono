This is an evolution of the [Smart-VFO](https://github.com/fcisotta/smart-vfo) project, to support a single band RTX.
Some features are simplified and specialized for the requirements of a one-band-only VFO (band definition being set at runtime in the calibration menu, fewer buttons required, etc.).

Further documentation will follow...
